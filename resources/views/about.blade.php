                        <h2>About us </h2>
                        <p>Law Cross was created to share and refer legal cases to legal firms and lawyers in the US and around the globe. The system helps lawyers and law firms share cases based on geographical location. LawCross helps assign cases to the right lawyers in the right jurisdiction and allows legal professionals to get advice and consultation from lawyers all over the globe.  </p>
                        <h3>About Case Transfer</h3>
                        <p>Cases can be shared between and among lawyers and law firms. Once the lawyer interested in taking or sharing a case selects it, the system connects that lawyer to the one initially responsible for the case. Then, they can work together on it. This same system applies to law firms.</p>
                        <h3>How it Works</h3>
                        <p>When a lawyer or law firm enrolls with LawCross, accepts the terms and conditions of the site and pays a $0 monthly membership fee, theyâ€™re free to use the service. </p>
                        <p>Once signed up, a lawyer or law firm can share cases on the site or search for cases to work on. A lawyer or law firm interested in taking on a case must disclose any conflict of interest information to Lawcross.com. Lawcross.com verifies the information provided by both parties and checks to ensure the case in question is still active. Lawcross.com then sends the request to the lawyer who initially posted the case. If the party is still interested in sharing the case, the lawyer taking on the case must accept the LawCross terms and agreement and pay $100 or 10%, whichever is less. The lawyers who offered and accepted the case may then work on their new case.</p>
